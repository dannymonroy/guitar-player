# Vanilla JS Guitar Player

This project is inspired by Wes Bos Drum Kit project. Since I liked it I thought it would be great to have it in a guitar version.

You can find the original project here: [Drum Kit](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

You are welcome to fork this project and add more chords or functionality.

The project is hosted temporally [here](http://titan.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~drodri06/guitar_player/)
